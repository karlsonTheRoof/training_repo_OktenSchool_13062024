        <p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="#">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a
                href="#">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited
            and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having
            adventures on the mythical island of <a href="#">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="#">Lost Boys</a>,
            interacting with <a href="#">fairies,
                pirates, mermaids, Native Americans</a>, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.
        </p>
        <p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="#">escapism</a>. In addition to two
            distinct works by Barrie, <a href="#">The Little White Bird</a> (1902, with chapters 13â€“18 published in <a
                    href="#">Peter Pan in
                Kensington Gardens</a> in 1906), and the <a href="#">West End stage</a> play <a href="#">Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a> (1904,
            which expanded into the 1911 novel <a href="#">Peter and Wendy</a>), the character has been featured in a variety of media
            and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television
            series and many other works.</p>
